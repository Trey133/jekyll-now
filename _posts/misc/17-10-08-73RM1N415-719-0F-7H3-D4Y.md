<p>Everyone needs an easy, reliable way to backup all of their important files. On Windows, this<br />
is pretty easy to do thanks to Windows Backup. On Linux operating systems, backing up your data<br />
is not always as easy as 'click click done...'.</p>
<p>However, their are a few programs out there that make it pretty easy to not only backup your files,<br />
but also schedule when the backup should occur.<br />
One such program is <a href="https://github.com/rastersoft/cronopete" target="_blank" title="Cronopete">Cronopete</a>.<br />

<p>With Cronopete you can configure exactly where your backup files should be stored, how long they<br />
are kept and how often your files should be backed up.</p>

<p>This program is perfect for users who want a simplistic interface and user friendly controls.</p>
<p>Although, my personal favorite backup software is Back-In-Time.<br />
{% highlight bash %}
apt-get install backintime-gnome
{% endhighlight %}
With Back-In-Time, you can do all the same things you can do with Cronopete, however, Back-In-Time<br />
offers a bit more customizable backup configuration than Cronopete. It also takes a bit more time to setup<br />
so if your looking for something you can use as soon as it's done installing, Cronopete is probably<br />
going to be the better choice for you. But, if you don't mind a little setup, and you want complete<br />
control of your backups, Back-In-Time is probably what your looking for.</p>

One of the coolest features of Back-In-Time, is the ability to exclude files based on specified patterns.<br />
This makes it really easy to exclude all the files with specific extentions or files located in<br />
specific directories without having to know the full name of the directory {be careful with this, you might<br />
accidently exclude important files and directories.}.</p>
<p>Back-In-Time also allows you to control when backup files are removed as well as a few<br />
other options.</p>

<p>If you really feel like you know what you are doing, Back-In-Time has a few 'expert'<br />
settings too.</p>
