<p>Have you ever needed to run a command over and over again in your terminal?<br />
All that repetitive typing can get old pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Save yourself a little time and start using 'watch'.</p>
<p>'watch' will run terminal commands periodically without the need for user intervention.<br />
For example, let's say we wanted to check the status of our SSH server every 60 seconds.<br />
We could do this with watch by entering the following in our terminal:<br />
watch -n 60 "service ssh status"</p>

    </a>
</figure>
<p>The '-n' above specifies the amount of time (in seconds) that watch should wait before running<br />
the command again.<br />
watch also provides us with several other options to help optimize our processes.</p>
<p>OPTIONS<br />
<hr width="100%">
       -d, --differences [permanent]<br />
              Highlight the differences between successive updates.  Option will read optional argument that changes highlight to be permanent, allowing to see<br />
              what has changed at least once since first iteration.<br /><br />

       -n, --interval seconds<br />
              Specify  update  interval.   The command will not allow quicker than 0.1 second interval, in which the smaller values are converted. Both '.' and<br />
              ',' work for any locales.<br /><br />

       -p, --precise<br />
              Make watch attempt to run command every interval seconds. Try it with ntptime and notice how the fractional seconds stays (nearly) the  same,  as<br />
              opposed to normal mode where they continuously increase.<br /><br />

       -t, --no-title<br />
              Turn off the header showing the interval, command, and current time at the top of the display, as well as the following blank line.<br /><br />

       -b, --beep<br />
              Beep if command has a non-zero exit.<br /><br />

       -e, --errexit<br />
              Freeze updates on command error, and exit after a key press.<br /><br />

       -g, --chgexit<br />
              Exit when the output of command changes.<br /><br />

       -c, --color<br />
              Interpret ANSI color and style sequences.<br /><br />

       -x, --exec<br />
              command  is  given  to  sh  -c  which means that you may need to use extra quoting to get the desired effect.  This with the --exec option, which<br />
              passes the command to exec(2) instead.<br /><br />

       -h, --help<br />
              Display help text and exit.<br /><br />

       -v, --version<br />
              Display version information and exit.<br /><br /></p>
<br />
<p>So the next time you are going to be typing the same command over and over for hours,<br />
remember this great tool and put off that arthritis for a few more years.
