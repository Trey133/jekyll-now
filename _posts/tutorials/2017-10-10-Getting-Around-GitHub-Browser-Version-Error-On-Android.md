title: Getting-Around-GitHub-Browser-Version-Error-On-Android
---
<p>I have been trying for three or four days now to get an Android app connected to my GitHub<br />
repo. The problem was, no matter what app I chose, I kept getting this error when I tried to login.<br />
"GitHub no longer supports your web browser. We recommend upgrading to the latest Google Chrome<br />
or Firefox." So, naturally the first thing I do is check my browser version and try to update<br /> 
Google Chrome on my Android phone. 'Browser is already the newest version'. Well that sucks...<br />
Let's just download Firefox and see if that will work.</p> 
  
<p>After downloading the Firefox Browser app from the Play Store, I tried to login to the app<br />
again. I still got the same error. After spending quite sometime online trying to find a solution, <br />
I tried one last time to login to the app. Luckily for me, I lost cell phone service before the <br />
GitHub authorization page loaded and instead I got the standard Android 'Page not found' error.<br /> 
At the bottom of the page was the url of the GitHub authorization page.</p>

<p>I copied the url and pasted it in my Google Chrome browser and like magic, it worked.<br />
I authorized the app from my browser then went back to the app to see if I was able to login. <br />
It worked like a charm. So to see if I could make it work again, I downloaded yet another <br />
'GitHub' app (please note that GitHub does not have an official Android app that I am aware of.) <br />
After the app downloaded, I turned on airplane mode and opened the app. Again I got the url and <br />
pasted it in the browser. It worked perfectly. </p>

<p>So if you are getting a browser version error trying to login to GitHub from an Android app, <br />
turn off your data, get the url from the login page, and authorize the app from your browser.</p>
