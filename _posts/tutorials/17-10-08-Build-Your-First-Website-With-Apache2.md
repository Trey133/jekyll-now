<p>Basic website development is one of those things that are super cool to learn but can<br />
be a little intimidating at first. In this tutorial I am going to show you how to create your very<br />
own, locally hosted, website. In a future tutorial, I will show you how to make your website<br />
visible to the rest of the world but for today, let's focus on building our website.</p>
<p>We are going to be using the Apache2 webserver for our website since it can be installed<br />
fairly easily and isn't too difficult for a newcomer to learn how to setup. Again, I will not<br />
be going over any advanced Apache2 functionalities, or anything at all past a little bit<br />
of HTML. This tutorial is for those of you who would like to learn how to develop<br />
your own websites, but have no idea how to do it without using those online services and website<br />
builders. If you just want a simple, basic website to show basic things like, your business info, pictures,<br />
or some other fairly small service, and you really don't care about the development part of it,<br />
this tutorial is NOT for you... Please go too google and type: 'Website Builder' or 'Build Website<br />
Easily Online'. This is just for those people that want to start their journey into website development.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul style="text-align: left">
<li>I will be using Kali Linux but any Linux Distro capable of running Apache2 will work</li><br /><br />
<li>Apache2 Webserver<sub>apt-get install apache2</sub></li><br /><br />
<li>Any text editor will do.</li><br /><br />
</ul>
<p>Once you have gotten Apache2 installed, navigate to your websites directory, which is located<br />
at '/var/www/html'. There you will find a file called 'index.html'. This is the default home page for your<br />
website. We are going to move this file to another folder and replace it with a file we are going<br />
to create ourselves.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and make a directory called 'default' in our /var/www/ directory.<br />
{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ../default
# or you could do
cd /var/www; mkdir default
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Once you have created your new default directory, move the index.html file to that directory.<br />
{% highlight bash %}
cd /var/www/html; mv index.html /var/www/default/
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Now lets go back to our html directory so we can create our new index.html file.<br />
Go ahead and open your text editor and let's begin.</p>
<p>At the top of your new page, add the line '<!DOCTYPE html>'. This tells the server that this is an html document.<br />
Next we will add the following lines:<br />
{% highlight html %}
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}
Now that you have the basic outline of your page, let's add some content.</p>
{% highlight html %}
<html>
<head>
<!-- Place your page title here -->
<title>My First Site!</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- Our content will go here. -->
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<!-- The 'h' tag specifies that this is a heading. The '1' specifies the size of the heading. {1-6} -->
<p>Welcome to my first website!</p>
<!-- The 'p' tag specifies a paragraph. You must specify the '/p' tag to close the paragraph. -->
<!-- This is also true with most of the tags we will use in our HTML adventures.
</body>
</html>
<!-- Don't forget to close your tags. Your website will not show up correctly if you forget. -->
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now that you have some content on your page, let's see what it looks like. Open your terminal<br />
and type the following to start the Apache2 webserver:<br />
{% highlight bash %}
sudo service apache2 start
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Now open your browser and navigate to '127.0.0.1'<br />
You should now be able to see your page!</p>
<p>Add more content and keep on building until you have a perfect site. Check out some of the sites<br />
in our 'Resources' tab at the top of the page to help you along in your development journey.</p>
<p>In our next Apache2 tutorial, I will go more into the server itself and how to make your site public.<br />
Today we just want to get our first site up and running so stay tunned for more great tutorials!</p>
