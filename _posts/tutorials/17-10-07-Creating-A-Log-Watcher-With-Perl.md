<p>Today I am going to show you how to create a Linux log watcher with Perl.<br />
I would like to note in advance that this is one of many ways to do this. You may know of<br />
a better way. If this is the case, we would certainly love to hear about it. Send an email<br />
to the address at the bottom of this page or just . </p>
