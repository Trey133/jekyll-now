title: New-MAC-On-Boot

<p>I ran into a problem a few months ago with macchanger on Kali Linux. The problem<br />
was that I could manually change my MAC address with macchanger but it would automatically<br />
change back to my real MAC address everytime I connected to a network I had connected to before.<p>
