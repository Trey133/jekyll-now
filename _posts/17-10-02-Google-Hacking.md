<p>As everyone already knows, Google is a great research tool for everyone from grade school children<br />
to scholars in the field. Almost everyone knows how simple it is to use and I'm sure most people<br />
feel that they have a pretty good handle on how to use Google. But, what if you were doing things<br />
the hard way? Think about it... Everyone has had that one search that they spent 'forever'<br />
with. Trying to find relavent information of Google is not always as easy as 'type your search term here'.</p>
<p>In todays tutorial, we will be discussing several of the more basic keywords that can be used <br />
in your Google search to find those perfect results in no time.</p>
<p>The first 'keyword' we will discuss isn't a word at all actually. The '"' {double quote} character<br /> 
can be used to tell Google that you want to search for a specific word or term.<br /><br />
EX: "python2.7" > This would tell google that all of the results should containt the term 'python2.7'.<br /><br />
If you place more than one word inside the double quotes, Google will get results with the words<br />
in the exact same order that you specified. You can also use '+' to tell Google that your results should<br />
include a specific word. You can string these together to create more specific results. If you want<br />
to tell Google that you want results to <em>exclude</em> a specific term, just use '-'.<br /><br />
EX: "funny puppy pictures" > All results will include 'funny' then 'puppy' then 'pictures' in a string<br />
somewhere on the webpage.<br /><br />
EX: +funny +puppy +pictures > All results will include the terms 'funny', 'puppy' and 'pictures'<br />
somewhere on the page. The order is not specified. +puppy +pictures +funny would yield the same<br />
results.<br /><br />
EX: +funny +puppy -cat > Google will return results containing the term 'funny' and 'puppy' but not the word 'cat'
</p>
<p>If you want to make sure that your results include only the webpages with your query somewhere in<br />
the text of the webpage {not in a title somewhere on the page}, then you can use the 'intext:' keyword<br /><br />
EX: intext:parrots intext:computers > This will search for sites with "parrots" and "computers" in a webpages text.
<br /><br />
</p>
<p>If you would rather search for a specific term located in a webpages title or url, you can use<br />
'intitle:' or 'inurl:' respectively. If you have multiple terms you would like to locate within a<br />
webpages title, you can use 'allintitle:'<br /><br />
EX: intitle:cattleblaster > This will return results with the term 'cattleblaster' in the webpages title.<br /><br />
EX: allintitle:north korean cattleblaster > This will find webpages with 'north', 'korean', and 'cattleblaster' all in the title of the webpage.<br /><br />
EX: inurl:smurffights > This query will return webpages with the term 'smurffights' in the url.<br /><br />
</p>
<p>If we wanted to search a specific site, say 'fakesite.org' for a term, we could use the 'site:' keyword<br /><br />
EX: site:fakesite.org "some interesting stuff" > This will search 'fakesite.org' for the phrase 'some interesting stuff'<br /></p>
<p>We can also search for specific filetypes and extentions using 'filetype:' or 'ext:'<br /><br />
EX: site:fakesite.org filetype:pdf > This will search 'fakesite.org' for any PDF files<br /><br />
EX: inurl:music ext:mp3 > This will return sites with the term 'music' in the url which also contain 'mp3' files<br /></p>
<p>Thats all for this tutorial. In the next Google Hacking Tutorial we will cover some of the more advanced<br />
ways to use Google's keywords to find specific content, files, and even people. Stay tunned!
