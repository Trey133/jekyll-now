title: Google Hacking
---
As everyone already knows, Google is a great research tool for everyone from grade school children<br />
to scholars in the field. Almost everyone knows how simple it is to use and I'm sure most people<br />
feel that they have a pretty good handle on how to use Google. But, what if you were doing things<br />
the hard way? Think about it... Everyone has had that one search that they spent 'forever'<br />
with. Trying to find relavent information of Google is not always as easy as 'type your search term here'.</p>
<p>In todays tutorial, we will be discussing several of the more basic keywords that can be used <br />
in your Google search to find those perfect results in no time.</p>
<p>The first 'keyword' we will discuss isn't a word at all actually. The '"' {double quote} character<br /> 
can be used to tell Google that you want to search for a specific word or term.<br />
EX: "python2.7" > This would tell google that all of the results should containt the term 'python2.7'.<br />
If you placce more than one word inside the double quotes, Google will get results with the words<br />
in the exact same order that you specified. You can also use '+' to tell Google that your results should<br />
include a specific word. You can string these together to create more specific results. If you want<br />
to tell Google that you do want results to <em>exclude</em> a specific term, just use '-'.<br />
<ul align="center">
<li>EX: "funny puppy pictures" > All results will include 'funny' then 'puppy' then 'pictures' in a string<br />
somwhere on the webpage.<br /></li>
<li>EX: +funny +puppy +pictures > All results will include the terms 'funny', 'puppy' and 'picture'<br />
somewhere on the page. The order is not specified. +puppy +pictures +funny would yeild the same<br />
results.</li></ul></p>
